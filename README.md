# cc0tree

Purpose of this database is to be a searchable on chain record of works that reference each other.

Each entry is a derivative work Contract address / token ID and an Original work Contract address / token ID


There are a lot of layer 1's and 2's with this right now, especially in the PFP world but barely any with music yet. 

And as we've seen in the music world, these references and samples can stack up many layers even in a licensing world.

Imagine how many iterations we'll need to keep track of as the decades go by.

The CC0Tree database is the backend for keeping track of that. Everything is free to enter and access.


Eventually I'd love a VR tree/graph to be able to touch nodes and hear the music for each one, like an immersive and more visual WhoSampled.com

Any front end devs are free to read the data and present however they want though.
